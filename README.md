# API for creating agreement between 2 users using Google Docs & Drive

-------------------------------------------------------------
## About
-------------------------------------------------------------

Using this API you can create agreement between 2 users. API uses **Google Docs** and **Drive** **APIs**. To work with this API you need ***Google service account*** and enabled **Google Docs API** and **Google Drive API**. API can be used as a backend for applications or CLI tools. For the purpose of simplicity SQLITE3 db system is used. 

**Routing** logic is managed using [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) library. **Database** logic is managed using [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm/) library.

Only **POST** HTTP requests work with **API**. Examples of requests can be viewed in ***example-requests.json*** file. Requests should be sent in json format, so responses are in json format too.

## Build
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install and configure go in your system https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Download your service account key (in json format) and place it somewhere safe. Create a .db file with following query:
```
   CREATE TABLE documents (
	doc_id TEXT UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	doc_title TEXT NOT NULL,
	doc_url TEXT NOT NULL,
	owner1 TEXT,
	owner2 TEXT,
	signed1 INTEGER,
	signed2 INTEGER,
	date_signed1 TEXT,
	date_signed2 TEXT
);
```
3. Set environmental variables:
   - SECRET_CREDENTIALS: should be a path to your *credentials.json* file (service account key). **E.g** /temp/example/credentials.json
   - DATABASE_FILE: should be a path to your database file (sqlite .db file). **E.g** /temp/example/docs.db
4. Build a project by using go tools: ***go build***
5. Run an executable with ***-account yourgoogle@email*** argument and (optional) ***-port :1234*** argument.
